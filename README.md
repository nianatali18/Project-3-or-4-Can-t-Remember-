# Project-3-or-4-Can-t-Remember-

##Summary:
I am going to be changing my entire website slightly to be a prototyp for a competition I am part of right now. 
I am going to be changing the titles for labled stuff and changing it to fit what I will be doing

#Plan 
I worked with a team who basically gave me the requirements for what needs to be added to the website and what will fit what we need

#Componants 

- Addition of a function that woukd allow a scanned bar code to be scanned and bring it to the page 

- Description of the product we created which is a biodegratable makeup towlette 

- Drop down tabs from the top to give options on 
   1) Information about the product
   2) Picture of the product
   3) How it is effective and why it is a good option

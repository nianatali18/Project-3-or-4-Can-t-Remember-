# Project-3/4 having some of each project requirement in each: 

##Summary:
I am going to be changing my entire website slightly to be a prototyp for a competition I am part of right now. 
I am going to be changing the titles for labled stuff and changing it to fit what I will be doing

#Plan 
I worked with a team who basically gave me the requirements for what needs to be added to the website and what will fit what we need

#Componants 

- Addition of a function that woukd allow a scanned bar code to be scanned and bring it to the page 

- Description of the product we created which is a biodegradable makeup towlette 

### Front Page 
- Picture of the product of the top stays at top does not follow
- Text does not follow if chosen to put on the image or near the image 

- Name of the product 

- Short description


- Drop down tabs from the top to give options on 
   1) Information about the product 
   2) Picture of the product and explanations
   3) How it is effective and why it is a good option 
   4) Why we cuilt this product 
   5) "who are we" page 


- Maybe a "see more button" that leads to one of the associated drop down tabs 
- Potentially a slide button or scroll option in the middle side of the page to show the ingredients that we used in our product that make it work, or moreso the "active ingredients" or ingredients that make it different/green. 



## Color scheme: 

 - Stick to neutral color

 - Images later on using the product
